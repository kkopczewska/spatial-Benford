# spatial-Benford

This collection of datafiles and codes allows for replicating study on: "Natural spatial pattern â€“ when mutual socio-geo distances between cities follow Benford's law"

What is the goal? 
We start with the dataset containing cities worldwide, their geo-location (lat/lon) and population. 
We want to test if there can be any explanation of where the city is and how many people live there. 
We check if three-dimensional (3D) distances between locations and populations (xyz) follow Benford law. 
We find they do - Benford law can explain the complex urban system - urban location and population are not random. 
As this model holds, we make statistical engineering to replicate 3D Benford. 
We analyse pure point patterns: regular, clustered and random and their mixtures. 
We find a composition which guarantees that points with values assigned conform with Benford (when analysed by 3D distance). 
This amazing statistical finding we explain with the history of urban settlement - and we find justification!
Have a nice reading and coding!

Explanations on dataset are in R Code file.
